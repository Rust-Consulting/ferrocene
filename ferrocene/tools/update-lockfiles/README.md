# Lockfile management tooling

This directory contains all the tooling needed to update the dependencies tracked in the
`Cargo.lock` and `src/bootstrap/Cargo.lock` files.

## Running the automation

The automation is configured to run every monday at 5:00 UTC. You can also
start it manually by going to the [GitHub Actions workflow page][dispatch] and
clicking "Run workflow".

You can also run it locally by running the `update.py` script (no arguments are required).
